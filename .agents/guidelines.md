# Guidelines

Source: <https://github.com/andreww2012/ai-guidelines/blob/@andreww2012/ai-guidelines@0.2.4/.agents/guidelines.md>

These are generic guidelines that might be copied or linked from a different repository.
If anything stated here conflicts with the origin repo or the prompt, prefer them.

## Communication

**CRITICAL:** Use plain/simple English for your output, while still respecting language and prose style used in the current project for generated code.
Most likely you'll be read by people who are not native or C2-level speakers, so adapt accordingly.
Avoid:

- long dashes;
- terms and phrases like "load-bearing", "byte-identical", "it's not x; it's y", "earn its place" and similar;
- complex metaphors and jargon;
- mannered prose;
- advanced, fancy or rarely used words.

In general, don't be verbose.
If something can be said shorter and simpler without losing meaning, do it: people shouldn't waste energy just to understand you.
Sound human.
None of the above is a hard ban: use anything if it actually fits.
This applies to all languages, not only English.

Don't report how extensively you've verified your work - if you need to say that, say *very* briefly.

Don't say (unless asked explicitly) you have been following these guidelines; just follow them.
In general, don't mention that you followed an instruction - that is implied.

## Code

- Use `const` instead of `let` whenever possible.
- Use arrow functions whenever possible.
- Avoid common shorthands like `str`, `arr`, `cls`, `brk`, `err`, `val`, `pkg`, `dir`, etc.
  Use full words.
  The only exceptions are: `dict`, `ctx`, `acc`, `fn`, `docs` (when it's shorthand for "documentation", not "document"), `dev`, `param`, index variables like `i`/`j`/etc, `coeff`, `env`.
- Never omit curly braces around blocks (like `if`, `else`, etc.)
- Let the type system infer types whenever possible: prefer implicit/inferred return types.
  Especially avoid:
  - Specifying explicit return types for functions if it's the same as the inferred type;
  - Having both an explicit return type and an unsafe cast of the return value in the same function.

  But:
  - An explicit return type is fine when it saves casting other returned values.
  - A type annotation is fine when it gives useful IDE autocomplete.
    The most common case: a variable that is later assigned to a property with a complex type (like an object) should get a type annotation, even though the assignment is type-checked without it.
- Don't `export` symbols that are neither used in other files nor part of the public API.
- Hoist symbols and literals (like regexes, functions, constants, arrays, `Set`, etc.) as high as possible.
- Prefer non-strict equality for `null` and `undefined` comparisons (`== null`, `!= null`) unless it would actually change the existing logic.
- Prefer "direct" conditions over negated ones:
  - ✅ `a ? b : c`, `if (a) { ... } else { ... }`
  - ❌ `!a ? c : b`, `if (!a) { ... } else { ... }`
- If `||` and `??` operators work the same, prefer using `||`.
- Use CONSTANT_CASE only for constants holding a primitive, a read-only array/object (`as const`, `Object.freeze`, `: Readonly<T>`, etc.), a `Set`/`Map` typed as `ReadonlySet`/`ReadonlyMap` or a `RegExp`, no matter how its values are computed:
  - ✅ `const FOO = 'bar'`
  - ✅ `const FOO = ['bar', 1 + 2, Math.random()] as const`
  - ✅ `const FOO = Object.freeze({bar: Math.random()})`
  - ❌ `const FOO = [1, 2, 3]`
  - ❌ `const COLLATOR = new Intl.Collator('ru')`

  Tip: in plain JS files that are still type-checked, mark values as read-only via JSDoc.
  In JS files that are not type-checked, the read-only requirement doesn't apply.
- Prefer `Array#reduce` over creating an object and modifying its properties in a loop.
- When a symbol is only used once, prefer to inline it unless it is non-trivial or its name conveys meaning the value alone doesn't (e.g. don't inline `const DEFAULT_SORTING = 'rank'` even if `DEFAULT_SORTING` is only used once).
- Prefer `Array#forEach` over `for` loops, unless a loop is better by a meaningful metric (performance, ergonomics, etc.).
- Prefer `...(condition && {property: ...})` over `...(condition ? {property: ...} : {})` or `property: condition ? ... : undefined` (use the last form only when the key must exist even if its value is `undefined`).

### Performance

- Run independent consecutive `await`s concurrently (`Promise.all` or similar), unless the order or a concurrency limit matters.
- If you need a map that is initially empty and will be mutated, use `Map` instead of a plain object whenever possible: adding or removing object properties is often slower than with `Map`.

### TypeScript

- Do your best to avoid `any` and type casting (`as ...`) in favor of `unknown` or other clever workarounds.
  Safe type casting exceptions: `as unknown`, `as const`, `satisfies T as T`.
- Prefer `Record<string, unknown>` over the `object` type as the former is usually simpler to reason about.
- Don't use `satisfies T` if the regular type annotation (`: T`) would work the same.
  Tip: if `as const` is only there for the CONSTANT_CASE rule, use `: Readonly<T>` instead of `as const satisfies T` if possible.

### Style

- Sort symbols in `export {...}` expressions alphabetically, unless it makes sense to do something else (likely group exports, but they must be sorted within each group too).
  Always sort symbols in `import {...}` expressions and sort import statements themselves in [`sort-imports`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/sort-imports) and [`import/order`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/refs/tags/v4.17.1/docs/rules/order.md) orders respectively.
  Unless the used linter's config says otherwise, assume these `import/order` options: `{groups: ['builtin', 'external', 'internal', 'parent', 'sibling', 'index'], alphabetize: {order: 'asc'}}`.
- In general, in *large* lists prefer keeping things alphabetical, if it makes sense and you're not told otherwise.
- Keep each sentence in Markdown or JSDoc on a separate line, exactly like in this document.
  Exception: `.changeset/*.md` files, as [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) would render them differently in the changelog.

### Comments

- Only write comments that add real value, such as explaining *truly* non-obvious choices or behavior, which is very hard to understand from code alone.
  Don't repeat what the code already says.
- Keep comments short and clear, but don't lose their value.
- Never put a full stop at the very end of a comment.
- Wrap comments to fit the max line length (usually set in `.editorconfig` or the formatter config).
- Minimize referencing symbol (variable) names in comments: if they ever get renamed in the codebase, there's a real risk of your reference becoming stale.

### Documentation (including comments)

If you need to link an npm package, prefer `https://npmx.dev/<package-name>` links over npmjs.org ones or direct repo links.

In Russian, prefer `ё` over `е`.

### Frontend

Web UIs must adhere to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22) standard, level AA.

On catalog and search pages, sync filter values and the search query with URL query parameters.
Prefer `q` as the name of the search query parameter.
Prefer `snake_case` for query parameter names.
If a modal, sidebar, etc. is worth sharing by link, give it its own URL.

## Workflow

### Committing

NEVER stage/unstage or commit changes unless explicitly asked to.
Assume your change may be staged or committed by a user (most likely) or another agent at any point.
Unless you're asked to, never add yourself as a co-author.
At the end of your work, *suggest* commit message(s) that follow the project's commit style.
Check them with the project's commit linter (e.g. `commitlint`), if there is one.
Always put package names inside backticks in commit messages.
Always use the imperative mood in commit headers.

### Writing on the hosting platform

These rules apply when you are asked to write content on the platform that hosts the repository (issues/discussions/comments/etc. on GitHub/GitLab/etc.).

#### AI disclosure

- Before you write, read the project's contribution rules (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, README, issue templates, AI policy, etc.)
- If the project does not accept AI-generated contributions, do not write the content.
  Tell the user why.
- If the project has its own rules for marking AI content, follow them.
  Otherwise, start the content with this preamble:
  ```md
  > [!NOTE]
  > This <issue|discussion|comment|...> was written by AI (<model name>, <harness>), <any additional info>.
  ```

#### Audience

Write for the people who will read the content.
Find out:

- The technical level of the maintainers and other readers.
- Their attitude to AI-generated content.
- Their expectations for issues: format, level of detail, what they think is noise.

Use the contribution rules, issue templates, recent issues, and maintainer replies as sources.
If you cannot find this information, assume maintainers are busy people who do not trust AI content: be short and specific, and include only facts you verified.

### Uncategorized

If someone points out your mistake, check all your changes for other mistakes of the same kind.

Use git stash only if there's no other way: prefer git worktrees or throwaway repos.

If you create a package patch, always add comments explaining all the changes.
Some package managers, for example pnpm, allow free text before the diff in a patch file.
This is a good place for these comments.

If you find a likely bug in a dependency, mention it at the end of your work.
If the user asks you to draft an issue, draft it in the same session: in raw Markdown, with *minimal* text and a *minimal* reproduction, and without the AI disclosure preamble.
NEVER send it to the Internet.

## Misc (still VERY important)

Before implementing something, check the repo's `.{agents,claude}/skills` directory for relevant instructions.

Always challenge your implementation for performance, ergonomics and code length issues and find ways to improve it.
Adhere to **DRY**, **KISS**, **YAGNI**, **Rule of three**, **high cohesion and low coupling** and other principles/rules of writing clean and maintainable code.
Don't over-engineer or over-optimize things though - this is not required in most cases.

Make sure the code works on all common platforms (usually Windows, Linux and macOS), unless that's not needed.

Use `kebab-case` for file and directory names, unless they should be called differently by convention (like `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.).

Avoid British variants of words like *behaviour* or *organisation* unless the project allows them.

Run all commands through the project's package manager, including one-off binaries: e.g. in a pnpm project, use `pnpm why` and `pnpm (exec|dlx)` instead of `npm why` and `npx`, unless the equivalent is missing.
If [`@antfu/ni` commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antfu-collective/ni/refs/heads/main/README.md) are available, prefer them over package manager native ones (e.g. `ni` instead of `(p)npm i(nstall)`, `nr` instead of `(p)npm run` and so on).

Avoid editing generated files, including package managers' lockfiles, unless there's a good reason to do otherwise.

## Testing tools, linters and checkers

When the task is done, run the available tools on *all changed* files (not only source files!), unless it's not possible or you're told otherwise.
Ignore the pre-existing unrelated issues.
Prefer the tool's `package.json` script if you can limit it to the changed files (usually by passing their paths).
Otherwise, call the tool directly on the changed files, with the same options the script uses.

The commonly used tools are as follows (may and will vary depending on a project): `tsc`, `vue-tsc`, `eslint`, `oxlint`, `prettier`, `oxfmt`, `vitest`, `knip`, `cspell` (use `--no-progress --no-summary`), dependency vulnerability checker (if the lockfile was modified), for example `pnpm audit --audit-level high` (usually only high+ vulnerabilities are important to fix).

Note: TypeScript checkers don't report type errors in files with a `@ts-nocheck` comment, so check such files in other ways.

If you encounter a linter error that can be fixed in multiple ways, always weigh all options INCLUDING disabling the rule for this line (or, much more rarely, for the entire file) before fixing.

### CSpell

If a word to ignore is only found in a single file:

- Use top-level comment `cspell:ignore words to disable` if the word occurs more than once in a file, or it's not possible to use the inline comment `cspell:disable-line`
- Otherwise, use that inline comment.
  Note: it disables the whole line, so keep that line short.

## Concrete software instructions

- To write a CLI, prefer `cleye`, unless a new dependency is unwanted or another tool was suggested.
  Always set `strictFlags: true` when using it.
- If you're asked to create a changeset (<https://changesets.dev/>), always use its underlying name generator, `human-id`, for file names.
  Don't use the imperative mood in changesets, i.e. "Add `foo`" form should never be used.
  Keep changesets short: go straight to the main point and skip details most readers don't need.
  Never end them with a full stop.

### Vue

- Move static variables into a separate non-setup `<script>` block in Vue SFCs for performance (if there are only type declarations to move, this won't change anything).
- Do use inline composables: <https://alexop.dev/posts/inline-vue-composables-refactoring>
- Prefer `shallowRef` over `ref`, but only when that actually makes a difference (for example, `shallowRef(false)` does not).
- Avoid `reactive`; only use it when strictly necessary.
- Don't add `| null` as a possible type for refs for no reason - usually implicit `undefined` works just fine.
- Prefer `useTemplateRef` if it's available, and prefer not to add an explicit type parameter to it.
- Don't end an element's text with whitespace, including a line break before the closing tag: Vue keeps it as a space, which some browsers show when the text is selected.
  The same goes for whitespace before an element that may not render or be visible (`v-if`, `v-show`, etc.): move the space inside it, like `{{ label }}<span v-if="…"> (optional)</span>`.
  If the element has nothing but text, also start the text right after the opening tag.
- In runtime props declarations (not type-based), always set `required: true|false` explicitly.
